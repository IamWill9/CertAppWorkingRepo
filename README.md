# CertApp

This is a graphical quiz application designed to help users study and practice for InfoSec certification, currently limited to  Microsoft SC-200 (Microsoft Security Operations Analyst) exam questions. The application uses Python's `tkinter` library for the user interface and supports:

- Multiple-choice questions
- Image-based questions
- Persistent memory of previously asked questions

## Features

- 🧠 Tracks previously asked questions to avoid repetition.
- 📊 Displays quiz results and relevant images based on performance.
- 🎨 Image rendering within questions using `matplotlib` and `PIL`.
- 🗓️ Records score history with dates and displays it after each quiz.
- 🌙 Optional dark mode via the `--dark` launch flag.
- 🔁 Missed questions are stored and asked first on the next quiz.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pillow matplotlib
```
## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
python main.py --file questions/sc-200.json --count 5 [--dark]
```

Questions are loaded from the specified JSON file. Images should remain in the `Images/` directory.

## File Structure

- `quiz_app.py` — Core quiz logic.
- `main.py` — Launcher script that loads a question file.
- `questions/` — Folder containing JSON question sets.
- `asked_questions.json` — Memory of previously asked questions.
